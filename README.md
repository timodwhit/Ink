# Ink

A lightweight journal that is meant to not get in the way of thought and just let you write.

The main goal of this small project is to provide me a quick way to see _chronological_ notes, similar to a chat with 
myself. 

This is meant to be like a pocket journal on your phone. You are meant to see your past thoughts, keep the journal numbers
low and just write.
